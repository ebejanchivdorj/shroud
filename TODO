give you option to skip CNAME validation check
README
need an easy way to develop between client/server
expand the development section of the README
expand the 'how does it work' section of the readme

Implement optional validity checks:
    - if you have a DNS TXT record, then shroud will check that it can complete a TLS connection with that cert

Open Qs:
    Run tor on the proxies to confuse traffic analysis?
    Long-running connections: easier to timing analysis or harder?
    Should traffic to proxies be over hidden service protocol?
    Longer circuit length?
    Regular heartbeat? Irregular heartbeat?

Later:
    man pages
    make website
    need signatures on downloadable binaries
    support proxies load-balancing to multiple clients (or single client with mutliple circuits)
    support a configuration file
    support multiple shrouded services with the same client
        - Requires a fix for how we connect to the proxies
    go-tunnel binders:
        allow caller to pass in mux?
        bind to 4443 instead of 443 and then update SRV records
